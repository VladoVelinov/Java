/*
Exercise 2.2:
Define an interface Shape with three methods: calculatePerimeter(), calculateSurface(), and shapeDetails(). Define two
classes, Rectangle and Circle, that implement Shape. The rectangle needs to have the properties width and height. The
Circle needs to have a property radius. Both the Circle and the Rectangle need to have implementation of the
calculatePerimeter() and calculateSurface() methods, that do the calculation according to the formula for the specific
shape. The classes also need to have an implementation of the shapeDetails() method, that returns a string, containing
the shape type, the corresponding properties, the calculated perimeter and surface. Define a ShapeInventory class, that
holds a List of Shapes. It has a displayInventory() method, that calls the shapeDetails() methods of all the Shape
objects that it holds and prints them. Also, create methods to add and remove shapes to the ShapeInventory. Write a
program, that creates several Rectangles and Circle objects with different sizes and adds them to the ShapeInventory,
then call the displayInventory method. Create an UML class diagram that reflects the classes in the problem.
